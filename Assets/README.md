### What is the Game?
A simple card-matching game where the player races against the clock to find all matching pairs before the clock strikes zero.
	
### How To Play?
Click on a black card with your mouse to reveal the card, and then try to find a matching pair. If you fail to find a pair, you get a slow penalty, and the selected cards hide themselves.
